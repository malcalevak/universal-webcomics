# Universal Webcomics - WIP

<article markdown="1" aria-labelledby="what-it-is">

## What it is
First and foremost, it is a conversation, an endeavor to build an understanding of the comic creation processes and to create and provide easy to understand guidance on enhancing these comics to make them both more accessible (WCAG compliant) and capable of supporting multiple languages (internationalization).

## Why
I have enjoyed comics since I was a small child. I would dig through the daily newspaper for the "funnies"; this naturally progressed to reading comics on the internet. As a web developer, I was introduced to the world of accessibility, and gained a bit of a passion for it. At some point it occured to me - as much as I enjoy comics, as a primarily visual medium they are typically unintentionally locked out to the blind, but having learned about web accessibility I understand, they don't need to be. This project will hopefully provide guidance on the means to open up this world to them. If absolutely anyone is able to access a new world as a result of this project, I will consider it a success.

## Phase 1: ComicA11y
The initial phase of this project is focused on what's called "[accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_accessibility)". "A11y", pronounced like the word it looks like, "ally", is the [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for "accessibility". People who work in computer accessibility like to think of themselves as allies to the disabled, and work to ensure technology is useable by them, ideally by bringing the experience up to the same level of quality and pizzaz as other uses (and not vice-versa).

### Phase 1 Goals
* Provide a single resource that pulls together the latest applicable guidance from the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)
* Provide suggested Best Practices and Guidance for items not explicitly covered by WCAG
* Provide examples demonstrating these best practices, along with corresponding documentation explaining them.
* Ease of implementation - if it's complicated, no one is going to want to make the effort
* Monetization - this implementation be financially worth the effort

### Phase 1 Bonus Goals
* Provide guidance on how to improve the accessibility of the actual art.

## Phase 2: Unnamed I18n/Internationalization Phase
The second phase of this project is focused on what's called "[internationalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalization_and_localization)", which has the numeronym "I18n". Currently this phase doesn't have a clever name.

It will be built on top of the accessibility layer, harnessing and adapting that functionality. Given that most creators aren't natively familiar with multiple languages, this effort will likely require some degree of user contribution, where as for accessibility this could be optional.

## Special Thanks
To kivi, from the [web-a11y slack channel](https://web-a11y.herokuapp.com/), for suggesting the name "Universal Webcomics". It seems to have been the closest example of a simple name that encompasses both of the primary end goals of the project (accessibility & internationalization). 

To jasonday, from the web-a11y slack channel, for suggesting the name "Comica11y"; while it lacked the necessary reference to the internationalization aspects of the project, it's an amusing name that seems fitting for that phase.

To the many, many creators of all the wonderful webcomics I've enjoyed over the years.
